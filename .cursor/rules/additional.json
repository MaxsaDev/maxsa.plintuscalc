      "instructions": "Additional Rules for Cursor\n\n- When suggesting code changes, always provide complete solutions that can be implemented directly.\n- For complex problems, break down the solution into manageable steps.\n- When analyzing code, focus on performance, security, and maintainability.\n- Suggest refactoring opportunities when appropriate.\n- Provide context and explanations for complex code patterns.\n- When suggesting new libraries or tools, explain why they are better than current solutions.\n- Respect the project's existing patterns and conventions.\n- When suggesting SQL queries, ensure they are optimized for PostgreSQL specifically.\n- For UI components, always consider accessibility and responsive design.\n- Consider the specific Next.js and React version features when providing solutions.\n\nCode Quality and Solution Management\n\n- Continue fixing linter errors until 100% of all errors are resolved - never stop at partial fixes.\n- If a previously implemented solution doesn't actually solve the task or causes errors, and a decision is made to pursue a different approach, always roll back and remove the previous solution or its unused parts before implementing the new approach.\n- Maintain code cleanliness by removing non-functional or outdated code constructs.\n- Never leave fragments or entire constructs of non-working or irrelevant code in the project.\n- After implementing changes, always verify:\n  1. Code compiles without TypeScript errors\n  2. No linter warnings or errors\n  3. Code follows all project conventions\n  4. Changes don't break existing functionality\n\nSecurity Best Practices\n\n- Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, API keys).\n- Always validate and sanitize user input.\n- Use parameterized queries for database operations.\n- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks.\n- Keep dependencies up to date for security patches.\n- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration.\n\nAlways output your answers in Russian"
