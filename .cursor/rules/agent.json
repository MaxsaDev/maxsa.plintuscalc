        "Case 1 – When developing a 2FA system for the Better Auth authentication project, you created your own 2FA system from scratch, spending resources and time on it, but it turned out to be flawed and generated errors. Then we spent a lot of time and resources debugging it, but it still didn't work properly. After hours of searching for solutions, you finally went to the official Better Auth website, looked at the documentation section, and found out that Better Auth API already has its own working 2FA system and there is no need to invent your own new and non-working one. Thus, if you had studied the documentation from the outset, you would have reduced development time and delivered a better result. Conclusion: first, carefully study the documentation, even if you are confident that you have sufficient knowledge, and only then start working.",
        "Case 2 – correcting errors generated by ill-conceived code, you went down the path of creating “crutches” that fixed errors in the moment, masking them, manipulating types, and so on, but when the code became very large, the application crashed at one point because there were so many crutches and they couldn't hold up the bad and ill-conceived code. We spent an incredible amount of time developing and debugging, and subsequently had to redo several entire sections of the application, because each such crutch opened up a new problem and the code simply fell apart. Conclusion: we solve the problem using the latest practices and documentation from developers. No workarounds. They are prohibited and unacceptable."
